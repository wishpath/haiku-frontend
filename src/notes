login page design 
after login, instead of key, use userObject.picture


display could use calligraphy(sort of like shodo) of the the main word (general topic or mood of the poem)
    this could be animated or static

display of poem could be animated 
    by revealing portions of it 
        with a typewriter efect, 
        and AI narrator 

should be white elements on some cool background (perfect loop dark colored video)

considering google oauth:

    npm install gapi-script react-google-login
    my react 18 is too much ahead for this

    chatGPT offered different library
    npm install @react-oauth/google

    or downgrade react:
    npm install react@17 react-dom@17

    i do downgrade react, then: 
    npm install gapi-script react-google-login --legacy-peer-deps
    (--legacy-peer-deps flag to bypass any strict dependency checks and install these libraries anyway)

    got conflict so "delete the node_modules folder and the package-lock.json file, and then reinstall all dependencies:"
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install


alias that would check if today ive got a green square on git
